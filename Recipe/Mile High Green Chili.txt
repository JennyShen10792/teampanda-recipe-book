Description: 
Green chili is a Colorado favorite, it's always a crowd pleaser when we have out-of-state visitors. Roasting your veggies first gives this recipe a deeper level of flavor. This can be served over rice as a main course, stuffed in enchiladas, or over potatoes and eggs.

Ingredients: 
3 chili peppers, 1 medium onion, 3 jalapeno peppers

Step-by-step cooking instructions: 
1. 1 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. 2 Arrange the halved tomatillos, Anaheim chiles, jalape√±os, onion, and bell pepper on a baking sheet. Drizzle vegetables with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with salt.
3. 3 Roast vegetables in the preheated oven until they begin to show brown spots, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool, then chop vegetables into bite-sized pieces.
4. 4 Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. 
5. 5 About 1/2 hour before serving, place cream cheese into a bowl and stir in about 1 tablespoon of the chili liquid until thoroughly combined.
